 what's going on youtube this is ipsec and today we're going to be doing something a little bit different and that is showing the new platform hack the box just launched called academy historically hack the box has always been about exploratory learning meaning they present you a challenge and it's up to you to teach yourself or find people to help you learn the techniques required to solve that challenge i personally love this style of learning as is very much what i'm required to do day to day in my job i can't just not complete a task because someone hasn't taught me how to do it yet it's up to me when i get a task i don't know how to solve to explore the internet or friendships in order to find the valuable piece of information to help me solve that task however this is not a great way to learn if you have no background in the subject to begin with so this platform is designed to give people the jumpstart they need by offering a guided learning experience which hopefully helps them gain the required knowledge to be efficient when doing exploratory learning and for the experienced people out there i think there's plenty of small nuggets of information from our personal experiences bundled into these courses so hopefully you'll find value in that too with all that being said let's just jump in in order to get started just go to academy.hackthebox.edu and you'll be brought to this page you can click sign up to create an account right now there's no single sign-on between hack the box and academy so you're going to have to create an account which when you do you'll get 30 cubes which can be used to buy some classes so create an account and then when you're logged in just click on dashboard and you'll be brought to your customized page this to-do list is going to be a list of everything you're working on and then you can have a button here just to pick up right where you left off to the right of that there is completed modules a module is like a class so this is example of a module the file inclusion slash directory traversal and then a path is going to be a collection of similar modules so if we go over to this path we can see there are three pads we've got a basic tool set cracking into and active directory enumeration so if you look at the basic tool set this is going to be a collection of four modules if we completed using nmap login brute forcing attacking web applications with phof and cracking password with hashcat we get credit for this entire path in order to know what modules cost we can go over to the purchase cube page and tier zero modules are going to be free so you can do all those right away with your 30 cubes and when you complete a module you get 20 of the cubes back unless it's tier 0 which you get all the cubes back but in order to buy cubes you see you get a discount if you do a monthly payment plan but if you just want to buy them on a one-time fee it's essentially divide the number of cubes by 10 and that's how many dollars it's going to cost so a thousand cubes is going to be 100 if you do it in a monthly plan you get a discount so 18 a month is a 10 discount 38 dollars is a 24 discount and 68 dollars you get a 32 discount on cubes keep in mind this kind of does stack when you complete modules you get 20 of the cubes back so if a module cost um a thousand cubes which is a hundred dollars you complete that you get 200 cubes back and if you have those cubes at a discount it's additionally more off so just keep in mind those discounts kind of stack um let's go over the models and look at them so let's go to tier zero and we can sort by the fundamental easy whatever i'm just gonna leave all the sorting on all and tier zero these can be the modules you can do without paying a dime every module costs 10 cubes but when you complete it you get 10 cubes back so these are the modules that you can do for free attacking web apps with faff windows fundamentals javascript the obfuscation web request the lfi module entry to academy and learning process tier one currently there's just nmap that is 50 cubes so five dollars and when you complete it you get twenty percent that back which is just ten going to tier 2 you have 100 cubes it cost and you get 20 back when you complete it tier 3 it unlocks with 500 cubes you get 100 back and tier 4 you guessed it 1 000 cubes and 200 back and i know this is gonna sound expensive up front because like the active directory power view class cost a hundred dollars but keep in mind you get twenty dollars back when you complete it and if you did the subscription plan you had a discount when you did cubes and this is more than just power view it's just mainly about power view and i worked with ben on that course and we tried to not use power view because i know a lot of people don't want to use it because it's deprecated but we spent like a week trying to do everything in.net that we could do in power view and just couldn't so until we know a better way to do some things we just left it at power view even though it's not being updated we believe that some groups gonna take over power view and it'll get updates just like um powershell empire did when it got deprecated so for now i think power view is still a super relevant thing to learn and additionally even if you didn't get any discounts the active directory course if we look at all three modules it's going to be around 250 dollars which when you compare that to other websites in order to learn like an active directory course it's going to cost more than that and the modules do go pretty in depth so we can click on like this bloodhound one that goes an overview of bloodhound data collection and then doing data collection with python analyzing data and whenever you see this icon that means there's going to be a lab with it the lab's really cool it uses phone box so you don't have to do a vm you can vpn if you want so it just gives you that interactive browser session in addition to that it spawns some customized lab for you to interact with so the bloodhound one is going to spawn a active directory lab for you to run bloodhound against um and after that there is a chapter on creating custom cipher queries it's going to go into some that are just not default that you'd want to do this is just super handy if you do the module it'll explain more and then a skills assessment at the end to make sure you understood what you just learned so this is kind of like an open book exam that you can just go back and take as many times as you want can't show you that because it does cost money so let's just look at a example module and tier 0 which will be the introduction to academy so i'm going to click unlock and we'll unlock it for 10 cubes and then start this module and we can see this is going to give us the instruction uh the path goes into a module and each module is divided into sections so this is the introduction to academy module and then the sections are over here to the right so this is talking about what a path is we should know that what a module is and what a section is so we can just mark this complete and go to next and then when we click continue on that main dashboard page it's going to bring us right back to section because we it knows we completed the introduction uh workstation it's talking about phone box again you can use the one that's provided for you or you can uh vpn in with your own os then it's talking about the interactive section with the icon next to it and the next one is going to be an interactive section i think this one just has yeah a single question so this isn't going to be any um like paren box interactive right now but there is a cheat sheet with a question to kind of help you along and then there's also a hint that says this is case sensitive so it wants the name of the module which is going to be introduction to academy and we can submit and we see it's incorrect so maybe this t is capital because the hint was case sensitive nope uh oh the first section of the module the very first section is introduction helps if i read the question that's embarrassing but we can click submit and then we get three cubes back because we completed the question so we can mark complete and go next and then we got a interactive section with a terminal so we can just click start instance and this is going to start our workstation i think the workstation by default is alive for two hours once you click start and it probably takes around 45 seconds to start so it's telling us to start uh locate the bash icon then do you name a one of the things i'm going to do is i'm going to switch into chrome because i just have better luck with chrome with doing some of these things so i'm going to go over and start chrome browser i just did alt f2 to launch that and we'll have that running we can click this full screen button we can also reset it oh it's um 60 minutes when we spawn the workstation and then we can click this to extend the life but i click full screen i'm just going to copy this link and we're going to go over to chrome and paste the link so we have our workstation in both um it wants the question based upon the command you executed what is likely to be the operating system flavor for this instance if we look at hint it's going to tell us it's the name of a bird so i'm going to click on this bash icon and we're going to do what the cheat sheet said and just run you name dash a and i see this says parent so i'm going to click this and we'll copy to see if we can copy out of this oh we can so firefox is letting me copy out the cursor is a bit ugly there i don't like the cursor if we switched over to chrome the cursor is better and again copying works here and if you ever have trouble with copying you can always click this icon in the bottom right browser's always finicky when you copy from like vnc sessions so this just helps you to copy so let's see what is the flavor of this instance it's gonna be parrot then we can submit the flag and move to the next module and we got three cubes back so i'm guessing this module is going to give us four cubes back because we got six already so the workstation is already spawned so let's see what the question is what is the proof text displayed on the target website you browsed so i'm going to click there to spawn the instance and this already spawned the machine for us to attack so it gave us this link and i'm going to switch over to chrome i don't know why it's not full screen why the resolution screwed up here maybe we'll just there we go i just had to move my browser for it to resize and i pressed f11 to full screen so i'm going to go into mozilla and i'm going to paste let's copy this again copy switch to chrome the one thing that's a little bit annoying in phone box is i don't think uh alt tab works so right click paste we do have it working there so i'm just going to control v to paste and we see the proof is targets so i'm just going to copy this alt tab over to firefox and paste this in and then we can make this one complete and move next we did get four cubes back and this is going over what modules is what the cost of each module is the to-do list explaining that stopping and starting the workstation and what a skill assessment is but this should be relatively self-explanatory based upon my descriptions i hope so we're just going to mark this complete and move next here we're talking about paths like the active directory and modern web attack and then the conclusion is just going to be talking more about how it's organized and letting us know to have fun so hope you guys enjoyed this little walkthrough of exactly what academy is hopefully it does help you all and take care and i'll see you all next time
