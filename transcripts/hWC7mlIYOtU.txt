 hello I'm Nick Eppolito and this video will show you one way to do the dungeon serve in the sands holiday hat challenge 2016 this challenge starts off with an elf giving us a zip file and in that zip file is a binary called dungeon and it's a company that file eggs became the binary reveals it's an old text-based game and like most text-based game it is not that intuitive and instead of playing the game we decided to a little bit of reversing and the first step was is this an old game that sans modified or did they create it from scratch so taking the string going and searching Google reveals that it is indeed Zork which is an old text-based game from probably 1978 so that is true the next step is to kind of figure out how the game works I remain in strings put dungeon in gdb and I couldn't find out where these strings were actually being pulled from in the binary so my guess is this is more of just an engine that pulls all the strings out of this DAT file and decodes it and that's what creates the actual map in your game so searching on Google again to try to figure out how to debug Zork I did short game debug and on the wiki it has a GD T command game debugging technique so I went back into my game type G DT and it is indeed a hidden menu for the game debuggers so we do help and we can change options Cyclops I guess is the big boss and Zork we can probably make it so we can't die but the thing we want to do was DT display text so a screen DT it says entry so let's do one it says welcome to dungeon this version was created 11 March 1978 which is the first line doing DT to done that's not the one we're looking for DT 3 DT 4 5 so it looks like this is indeed what we want to do and instead of Manley going through all these I had wrote and expect script and I did the expect script in turn tools just in case we had a exploit we came across the skeleton of this would already be done so what parent tools is doing is it's gonna execute binary and it's gonna receive until we have this greater than sign and once it sees greater than sign it's gonna send gdt it's gonna receive until it sees G DT greater than sign and then enter an infinite loop incrementing I it's gonna send DT wait for entry then send the next number so when we execute this we see it sends a bunch of things and after twelve hundred and thirty it crashes but scrolling up we get back to the game and around 1024 it says the elf's satisfied with the trade says try the online version for the true prize so the online version is over at dungeon dot Northport Wonderland comm and if we and map that it should return a website as a sage and port one one one one one so when an NC to that port netcat and see exactly what that is and it's the game and let's see if they left this game debugging technique in the game they did do dt 1024 because that was the one we saw on a local version I said shy online and it says send an email to peppermint at North Pole wonderland calm and indeed once you email him he will email you the audio file back and that was pretty simple no real exploits just writing expect script and yeah that's the challenge hope you guys enjoyed the video take care
