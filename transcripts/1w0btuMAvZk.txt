 what's going on youtube this is ipsec and this will be a quick and simple video on setting up slack web hooks i primarily use this when setting up some quick and dirty monitoring on systems so my monitors can actually send notifications via slack if you watch my recent video on the active directory honeypots i used a canary token to send alerts via email you could just replace that whole canary token piece with this piece if you want to send those alerts via slack instead of email because some people prefer that so with that being said let's just jump in so here we are on the slack website all we have to do is click try it for free and then continue with our google account and it will automatically create us a workspace so we can do create new workspace and it's going to put us in a slack web client that is just got awful so i'm going to go to slack.com we'll go to products and download the client this should be downloading download slack oh 64-bit there it is and we have slack set up it looks like it's going to take a couple minutes to download so i'm going to pause the video oh no no need to pause already done so refresh let's run it i think it needs to be ran as administrator i'm not positive but wait for it to start i'm guessing it's going back to microsoft to do some type of smart screen checks or something like that since it is taking its sweet time here there we go looks like it has started installing and here we go so we can just click sign in it's going to take us to the browser we can just open this in slack and this web hook should log us into a workspace which will then let us create a web hook for a channel that was weird open and slack okay so now it is loading so we just have to give the workspace a name i'm just going to call it ipsec and then add teammates uh there should be a skip this step yep and what are we working on um i'm going to do monitoring so now we have the monitoring channel created i'm going to right click well right click it view channel details i believe and then the first thing i want to do is make this a private channel so random people can't join this it's just a security thing because we're putting monitoring in sensitive details could be here now we can go over to integrations add an app and then i'm just going to type webhook and add this app it says it's a legacy app and it could go away so hopefully it doesn't go away because this is super easy to use and i like this over other apps because it can only um send messages right you can put like full out bots that can interact with it but the way we're going to be using this is not ideal for that anyways let's just click on the monitoring channel and then add the wet incoming web hook thing and copy this url so i'm going to open up notepad and we're going to put this here and i'm going to save this just so we have it in the future and it tells us how to use it so we create a payload like this and then just post it i believe let's see we can set an icon emoji here we go so let's just copy this and then go over to our monitoring channel i think it's installed already so let's open up a command prompt powershell and let's paste what it gave us so it's going to go in the channel monitoring the username is going to be webhook bot and that's the text and invalid i wonder if it doesn't like all the escapes actually it doesn't like the dash x post i'm guessing dash dash data url encode it doesn't like as well um i'm just going to switch over to invoke web request because i know that syntax a bit better so it's invoke well invoke rest method and then we can give it the url so it's going to be this and then we want to give it dash method post and dash body i'm going to put the body in as a variable and then content type is going to be application json and then body is going to be convert to json and we're going to give it some data so we can give pretext is equal to um automated alert and text is equal to please subscribe so let's see what happens with this if i typed it right so if we paste this in no syntax error that is a good thing paste this [Music] parameter can't be found that matches content type uh probably no dash paste there we go and we have the automated alert right here um if we look at the other one up here let's see it's got a username i'm going to add username to this to see if it changes username is equal to uh we'll do this we'll call it bot we're not going to be creative here right um so let's copy this go back to a powershell paste and we have successfully changed the um username and the last thing we can do is icon emoji and put this over to ghost it's equal to ghost and see what this looks i'm sure there's other emojis we could give it uh i wonder if that didn't work because maybe it just didn't put a new icon yeah there we go so we have some automation now well not automation but a way to send messages into slack and then the last piece that's going to be useful for future videos is putting actual variables in this text so let's do that real quick um we're going to say message is equal to and i believe i can just do env computer name i'm gonna say oh god i'm on insert hostname env dot computer name and i think i can put this in brackets like that i'm gonna check this out real quick message that did not work um is it like this definitely not that env computer name um env is it env colon computer name yes so env colon message that is good and then i can do um like a backtick n for line break i'm going to do username and then env colon username and if we look at this message that looks good and where the text is now i can just put dollar message and if we send all of this we have our automated alert so hope this all made sense um and enjoy its use in the future videos take care guys and i'll see you all next time
