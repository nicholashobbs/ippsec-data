 what is going on everyone thank you for tuning in to my talk which is the variable is what you make of it and by that X could be equals to one which means it's normally an integer but there's no reason you can't redeclare that into a string because you control the universe around it there is no spoon to bend because you can bend reality um X doesn't have to be a programming thing it could be a negative experience in your life but you look at all the positive things that came out of it and willed that negative into being a positive which is one of the best things you can do for your mental health and yes this talks can get both into Technical and mental things because it's all the advice I wish I had a decade ago so with that being said let's get over into the agenda because I know I'm going to lose some people at some point so hopefully knowing these things come next keeps you interested in the talk so starting off I'm gonna do the intro who am I I'm gonna put a different spin on it and talk about my journey instead of all the places I've worked because places I've worked aren't really that interesting um then we're getting into the technical tips about keeping it simple the importance of Recon and how to ask questions what which yes I put under a technical thing because it's something you should be doing uh like all the time right after that we're going to go into keeping a positive mindset by stopping the use of words like fail and just what a learning curve is because I find that to be very important and then finally we're going to wrap it up with the reason behind the Titleist talk which is life is what you make of it how to not do the bare minimum and go beyond so who am I well currently I'm a senior lab architect at hack the box which I find to be a funny title because no one really knows what that title means until you look at it in depth if you abbreviate it it's SOA service level agreement which generally means quality assurance QA right and that's mostly my job right I just go between all the Departments of hack the box and make sure that people are up to like my standards or try to help them right A lot of people don't like QA roles it's not a coveted job title because generally they don't go beyond the bare minimum and just follow a Playbook but me I gently try to raise the bar wherever I go so I interact with the community team which I'm talking to you now guys and then I go over to the content team and help build machines I work on the pro Labs occasionally I do some infrastructury things sometimes I do development add features or fix bad things on the site I just wear many hats because I'm in QA I can do what I want right um primarily I'm self-taught and love jumping between a bunch of topics I have ADHD if you can't tell so um I find it kind of funny that I'm self-taught but also giving a talk for a university because I never went to college um I wish I did I just did it because I was working right away and didn't really have the time but um college is one of those things that I'm very envious of because of all the socialization I don't mean all the parting in colleges I mean all the Collegiate events right for instance the uni CTF that you're doing right now that's only available to college students so that's awesome there's also like the national cyber League NCL Collegiate cyber defense competition CCDC the Seesaw the U.S cyber team there's a bunch over in Europe that I don't know there's so many Collegiate cyber events for kids it's just amazing now right the community has changed so much since like 2017 when hack the Box started and it's a funny story because when hack the Box started we didn't have a concept of retired videos or retired machines which meant you can't talk about any machine ever there is no talking about machines it was all like the try harder mentality eventually they started retiring machines I started doing YouTube videos and it became a moderator at the site and when I became a moderator I did what everyone does when they first do it and that search your name in the private chat and see what people said about you when they didn't think you could read it right and it was kind of funny there was a debate like the very first mention of ipsec in the hack the Box slack is about um if videos are a good thing for the community or whatnot obviously I think seven years later we know they are it's just amazing how much the community has changed and I can't wait to see what the community does and grows in the next five years if you don't know about me and you're confused about everything I've said check out ipsec.rocks it's where I index all my videos I want to say I have over 300 hours of content they can easily search through ipsec.rocks those are my contributions link on that page that I try to put everything that I've contributed back to the community including things I've made or um interviews I've done things like that previous to hack the box I was a CIS admin security purple teamer developer it's an interesting story I guess because my very first place I applied to as a kid was a grocery store Weiss and I got denied and then I went to funkoland which is a video game retailer I guess kind of like Best Buy and I got denied eventually I was an Umpire for a local baseball league because they didn't turn anyone down but my high school teacher who also taught at colleges sent my resume into companies that asked for good college students because I did some coding on the side with Planet source code that is like a precursor to GitHub so it was just an open source code sharing place and I had a Blog the company hired me so I had a nice job right out of high school they were thinking I was a college student I kind of social engineered my way into that one after seven eight years I got laid off from that company I know crazy IPS at getting laid off from a job and I thought it was a very bad thing at the time like I thought the world was crumbling down but looking back at that experience it's probably one of the best things that happened to me because I got a new job and that new job they did a lot of things differently not necessarily better or worse just differently and that let me learn so much and it changed my perspective a lot switching jobs I got that new job not because of my technical Merit it was because I was playing Starcraft with a lot of friends I did shout casting back in the day and they're like you're a cool person our company needs assist admin I hear you do CIS add many things do you want a job I was like yeah I do and that was that um I mentioned the shoutcasting thing because I actually grew up with a speech impediment called radicism and I had a stutter right but shout casting if you don't know is like um John Madden is to football as a shoutcaster is to video games they just like commentate Pro Gamers playing video games which I know is crazy if you don't know anything about that scene like you can make money playing video games what but um yeah I did shout casting mainly to improve my speech because a lot of people said I couldn't talk and I wanted to prove them wrong so um I did that for a long time that's also partly why I do the videos to help keep improving my speech because when I get into security it took so much time I couldn't place Starcraft anymore eventually that company sold to another company it became not a great place to work I followed a friend there to a different company which then I quit during covid because uh covet changed a lot of things and I wanted full remote work which is when I joined hack the box right so that is like my life in a nutshell and I say all that because I put a lot of prioritization on my socialization not my technical abilities because that's what's helped me the most right and that is just my opinion there's gonna be a lot of opinions in this talk I'm not saying all my opinions are the correct ones they're probably wrong um the answer is probably somewhere between my opinion and your opinion so take what resonates with you ahead and just use this as food for thought I guess right so my first opinion that I'll shout from a rooftop is hacking is an art and not a science by that I mean hacking really benefits from a little bit of human intuition if it was a problem that can be solved programmatically easily then companies like tenable with nessus or rapid7 with next per se before nessus there was retina security scanners had been around forever they would have solved this problem um it's not an easy problem to solve because of that human intuition and I find it kind of funny because whenever someone starts out in the field they start off with the bad flow chart um because it goes very much like a program would do right they all just run all these tools and say I'm gonna run uh nmap I see it has a web server so I'm going to run nictor Go Buster pharaohbuster because those do web summary things then I see a login page I'm going to run SQL map to see if it's SQL injectable I don't know what this variable is I'm going to run TPO map because I don't know what this program does but I had good results in the past or I saw someone running once upon a time so I'm just gonna always add this into my workflow then I'm going to run bip Suite scanners SQL injection payloads and eventually you have this giant haystack and there's a is very small needle that you're looking for that is the vulnerability but you put so much information around it you've obscured it right I don't like these tool based flow charts or if I see this I run all these things instead I follow a much more question based thing right it's kind of more of a social concept what points are open what applications are these I don't say the ports tied to nmap because you may not always use nmap to find the port sometimes you just use netstat right if you're on the box does this cooking name mean anything because often the cookie will link what framework it is what language it is PHP loves PHP session ID Java loves J session ID so you can identify the languages sometimes Fields just look injectable your spidey sense goes off I'm not saying don't run tools but whenever I run a tool I think like will a tool answer this question because every time you ask a question the haystack is so small you know what you're looking for and since the haystack small the needle stands out more so you get the small Haystack look for the needle don't see it ask another question build upon that look for the needle don't see it and just keep that pattern going right so keep it simple let's say we have rce on our server right A lot of people may just go straight into throwing a reverse shell and this is just a simple thing that gets you a command line access to a Linux server remotely right but there's a lot of ways this can fail and when something fails you don't know why it failed you can ask comp like any question you ask the server it's going to return to Boolean yes or no back to you right so you're going to ask hey send me this shell and it's going to respond no you don't know what question it responded no to you may not be in bash it may not be a Linux box because it could be BSD Solaris Windows whatever um maybe the server didn't understand all those special redirection characters like that greater than Ampersand things maybe Port 9001 was marked maybe the server didn't block you maybe the network did maybe AV or EDR blocked access to bash there's a hundred ways this command can fail and all you know is the command failed not y right so if you keep it simple then you can extract information out of that right if you didn't do the reverse Shell First and just did pingattacker.com um icamp is going to be allowed to the firewall more often than TCP so maybe you get a response there if not ping generally takes a while to run so maybe their Quest takes longer if for some reason both of those were no you may still get a DNS request if the Box tried to resolve attacker.com to you right so there's two different ways you're trying to Traverse the firewall icmp works most of the time DNS works almost always um if you don't have rce you can just test it off with like an echo test and if you don't see the word echo in the response but you see the word test chances are it process that or you can just go the Sleep route and do a Time base and see if the page takes long to respond right there's a lot of ways you can keep it simple so when it fails you know why it failed right either um you're trying to get it so it fails and you know it failed because it's not vulnerable not it failed because something blocked you right I find that to be very important so keeping along this mindset ask simple questions right let's say we have a server-side template injection which is a looks like a complicated exploit if you're not familiar with this but you can notice it's doing this thing I want to say this is the Ginger 2 template essentially it's an attack and rendering engines right um python web developers have this web page that they create in HTML and then they put these two uh brackets around it to put variables from the programming language into the page so the user gets Dynamic content right and this is a valid template right it's got two squigglies here two squigglies here there's no mismatch so the templating language is is going to process it it fails it just returns nothing right it doesn't error out it returns nothing which makes it hard to identify if this failed you just get um a blank spot where it failed versus if you just sent one squiggly bracket you may cause an error in the whole templating language itself and get uh nothing back from the page like error 500 right so at this point you may be asking well if I keep it this simple and just ask characters one ask questions one character at a time it's gonna take forever right but that's why fuzzing exists so I like using tools like fat uh fuzz faster you fool or W fuzz which is a python version of this um search dot request this is just a HTTP request I put fuzz and capital letters where I want to send the input to the web page special characters dot text this is just a text file that contains all the special characters right and then MC all this is going to be match code all by default fuff doesn't match all status codes and I want it to match it all so I see every result so what you get is US sending the percent to the web server and then the response back us sending the asterisks to the web server and the response back right so we can ask the server many questions really quick and glance and see the answers right if you want to know more about this check out the academy uh course or just go to ipsec.rocks and typefuff so let's play a game Guess That vulnerability from fuff output right looking at this you see two things stick out there's the size 61 at two places this one's kind of a false positive the ampersand's a weird character when it comes to this because if you don't tell it to doesn't your low URL encode anything and the Ampersand is used as a delimiter for variables so oftentimes the web server just ignores it um the key one is the single quote in this case it's an SQL injection it's not always going to be an SQL injection it goes back to creating an uneven number of quotes squiggly brackets whatever um but more often than not it's going to be SQL injection because um databases are very common on web applications much more common than executing system commands so that's why it's SQL injection just because more common than not the key thing here is I'd ask the server what happens if I send you a single quote and the server is like uh error and you're like okay I'm going to experiment on this more right so that was fun let's do it again this one changes quite a bit um the web server on this hand is echoing the results back to us and there's a lot of weird things like we see the um greater than sign has a different size than most things and the reason for that is actually a protection in place if you don't filter out these characters the greater than a less than sign then it's probably going to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting because the attacker can put HTML all characters on the page so how it works under the hood is the web server translates this into I think an ampersand GT semicolon for greater than and then whenever the web browser displays it it displays it as a greater than sign but doesn't treat it as HTML so it's not vulnerable to H cross-site scripting the key thing here though is the era 500 codes when it sees squiggly brackets and that tells me I should go into server-side template injection and look at it more right but it's not all about fuzzing also reading between the lines is very important so here we have a bunch of nmap output um the key things here probably I would point out the engine X server header and then also a j session ID when you see engine X and Tomcat chances are there's going to be some type of URL parsing bugs you can look at the orange side presentations or you can just go to ipsec.rocks type in engine X Tomcat or Apache tomcat and find some relevant videos right so this is reading between the lines and maps not telling us there's a vulnerability but because we can combine two things we know we should probably should look for a vulnerability and doesn't mean there isn't one just means this is the path we should go down right we read between those two lines and saw something next one this is a bit more tricky that I think most people would miss um the thing that stands right out is this work Zog server header which isn't a great thing it's just a python web server but that's not what I want to point out here what I want to point out here is the SSH Banner you notice something odd here in this python um whoops the SSH Banner says it's Ubuntu bionic which is an old version of Ubuntu generally it has I think python 3.6 and we have a python 3.10 Banner here most the time developers don't install a different version of python than what comes with the operating system because that just creates a bunch of mess um so here there's probably either Network address translation not into play or it's running Docker right and if it's a Ubuntu box itself chances are it's going to be running some type of virtualization technology like Docker and in this sense knowing Docker is Handy to us because Docker is a very stripped down OS so when we try rce things chances are things like Ping and stuff won't be on the box so we know not to try that or if it fails it may have failed because ping didn't exist which in most cases is unique but not in Docker right so this is the little bit of information we can extract from banners that happens if you read between the lines the final one it's so easy you could probably search anything on it so we're not going to play a game um if you ever get an error page that doesn't say Apache or engine X there's probably something on that page that can tell you where that error came from you may think white label error page is a common string but if you just Google this it tells you it's the spring boot framework which then opens up a lot of new possibilities that you can attack spring boot vulnerable to server side template ejection it's Java so there's the um log for a j thing that just came out there's a bunch of Tomcat type exploits you could try you could try that URL parsing bug there's just a lot of things you can try maybe Java deserialization just different attack pads that open up once you know what the framework is and at this point you're probably saying wow this is a lot of information how do you learn all of this stuff because we're not really taught it and the reason why I learned this is because I understand the importance of asking questions I love questions I ask myself questions I ask other people questions I ask my dog questions I ask my computer questions I ask my drinks questions like I always question everything which sometimes is annoying but um that's how I learned right I find a lot of people only ask questions when they're having trouble because they use it as a way to keep them motivated and stop banging their head against the wall the next important thing you can do is ask questions when you complete something so both you and your friend completed a box ask them how they completed it see how they did it see if they did anything better than you build up your framework that way and then finally I always like asking myself questions so if I did something and there was a step I didn't like I'm like okay let's remove that step maybe I guessed completely here was there anything I missed on this box now that I have root that I could have done in order to um find this answer differently right also questions will help you make friends and build relationships that set you up for Success later but asking questions is not easy there's us like aren't asking questions I find a lot of people fall into the game of tag quite often when they ask a question I always hate when I see a message that just says hey may I ask a question you already did right um it's better to bait them into a question by explaining where you're at and how hard you've tried if you just come to me say hey I'm having trouble with this uni CTF challenge I'm gonna be like well I don't know how to help you and just move on with my life right but if you go and explain what challenge you're having the things you've tried by just explaining it to yourself chances are you realize what you missed and may answer the question yourself or you may bait the person into answering the question for you an example question I have is hey I'm doing this challenge I've proven cross-site scripting with HTML tags but I'm having trouble bypassing a filter that believe is blocking IP addresses because of blank right and the answer here is URL encoding the IP address by like an IP address it could be 127.001 and there's nothing that prevents you from using um 0x7f which is 127 double zero double zero one so 127001 and hex and it resolves if you don't believe me open up a command prompt type ping0x7f0001 and you'll be amazed that it pings localhost right um I like this question because it actually baited me into hack the Box this is from the holiday machine someone asked me this question I was like wow that was very creative somehow I knew the answer and I was like would you like run into this I want to do more of this and that was hack the box so that's what got me on the platform so the question not only helped the person asking it but helped me because if they didn't ask it I may not be on hack the box and I may be at a completely different point in life right now right so um questions help everyone once you ask a lot of questions you also have to keep a positive mindset a lot of people may ignore you you can't take that as a negative just move on with your life also this is going to be a hard field it requires a lot of time and there's always this unrealistic jack of all trades except expectation set of you right because you're the attacker um the defender they get to build the playing field they build it how they want they research the Technologies they put in place they know the Frameworks you may not know Django flask spring boot whatever but you have a good enough Foundation because you spent so much time learning this that all those Frameworks boil down to http you can intercept the packets and burp suite and just turn the battlefield into one you're familiar with right um I think another reason this field is heard is because of certifications um if you look at the Blue Team field all the certifications are vendor based and I think that makes it a bit easier because there's another motivation for you getting certified that most people don't think about so if you think of blue team certifications Microsoft Red Hat Cisco Juniper like all the vendors produce these things right and if I'm a CCNA which is a relatively entry-level Cisco certification I'm not going to recommend Company by Juniper equipment and if I get hired for a CCNA a networking position the company's not gonna be like great you're a CCNA we hired you here's a bunch of generic weapon good luck I hope you can understand it that just doesn't happen well it probably does but it shouldn't happen right so when you have blue team the certifications convert you into like a mini advertisement for that company right and the offensive security space we don't really have that like Sans offensive security hacked the Box all of us like we teach techniques we're not really a vendor-based solution right and that creates a lot of learning curves which can be demotivating essentially the learning curve think of riding a bike it was really tough until you did it and then it was easy if you don't believe me that this field is a learning curve ask anyone taking oscp they're going to say it's the hardest thing they've ever done then wait a month or two once they pass and then ask them again they're gonna say what took me so long right generally that means there's a learning curve you change your mindset and then this field becomes easy and I think the mindset that you have to change is learning how to troubleshoot things properly and thinking on a question based thing and not a tool based thing I think those two things will help you get into this field the other reason why it's hard to keep a positive mindset other than learning is security wins on others failures so if you ask anyone that's in the field they generally do the same thing over and over again why do people click on these phishing emails why don't people update no one checks these alerts it's so easy to fall into those negative things instead of thinking about positives and when you keep thinking about negatives your brain is going to lead to negative things more often than not and things that you used to think as positive experiences since you've like hardwired your brain to treat more things as negative you'll lead into negative things and become a negative person over time which just is not good so um the easiest way to not become a negative person is eliminating the word fail from your vocabulary you did not fail try to look at the positives right you're taking a test you didn't get the outcome you want well you learned what you didn't know which is a very hard thing to learn if you're on a job say a company hired you to hack them and they stopped you highlight how they stopped you highlight all their defenses a company when they get like higher for a pen test they want to hear how good they are they don't want to hear how bad they are so you're not going to upset them by handing them a report that says all these blinking boxes things that you installed and configured correctly did stop the attack right so they're going to love that report in hindsight you're going to remember all the things that stopped you so when you go to a conference and socialize you can talk about those defenses and find ways around them to better yourself right there's always positive experiences even though or if on the cover it's a negative thing so try to take positives away from every experience and the easiest way to do that is by stopping doing the bare minimum if you only do what is asked well chances are it's not what you exactly wanted right so the easiest way to do more than the bare minimum is redefine done so for instance when I was a CIS admin I used to do a lot of server hardening and I thought it was one of the silliest things to do to harden up to a certain standard because there are a lot of things I just didn't understand right or I didn't find Value in it for instance in hindsight one of the silliest things is I hated hurting like php.ini files to block system commands from executing because the web application doesn't use systems so why should I worry about blocking that right um well attackers can put that in and that's good right another one is like Windows has this fips encryption group policy that may do nothing but it actually stopped one of my C2 tests because I used rc4 encryption and Phipps doesn't allow rc4 or maybe it was x-ray it was one of the basic levels of encryption I was like well that fit standard actually blocked a lot of c2s who knew right going Beyond um no one to ever complain and you do learn things and um it also helps convert those negatives into positives if you're in a CTF don't stop at the flags go beyond root as me and oxtf say right the flags are what the machine Creator forced you to do you did it because you kind of wanted to do it you may have not want to do all the things the machine creator has said but once you root the machine it's all you right you can decide what you want to do you want to go and focus on web development you can see how they coded the web application or code or whatever it was you want to go into how to do secure coding well you're already looking at the code want to go into detection you can put like audit D on the box and look at the um logs and see what alerts you created you can literally do anything once you get the flag it's only about 50 and lastly um when you go beyond you often socialize and learn from others right so practice makes perfect the key to success is repetition the results are not going to be quick in this field you can't hack time I always say whenever you have a long running Recon task make sure you run it first because if you're on the very last hour and you're like man I didn't run SQL buster you'll get the result and then it's going to be over and you're gonna hate life right always start the Recon tasks up front because you can't hack Time same with when you try to get results if you just say I'm gonna be a hacker I'm going to study really hard for two days chances are you're not going to see results in three days right just um know you get results over time and also write down every win this is going to help you understand with um repetition that good things will come also the mind works in mysterious ways right you can't just surgically remove one memory from a person because the brain as we understand is this complex thing of neurons with a bunch of things going around it right if you just do something one time you create one neuron to one memory and then we do things multiple ways you're creating more passageways there and that just helps with memory retention because you're strengthening that memory right there's a bigger network of neurons that know how to get there um that's also why if you focus on negative things or think negatively a lot of ways it's easier to hardwire your brain to think negative and why I think like a lot of people are in like this self-defense mode because everyone's been so scared of covet for the last two or three years that they've just been thinking negatively for so long their brain's hardwired to thinking negative because they've strengthened those neurons not thinking about positive things so the easiest way to rewire your brain to think positively is slow down write down spend whenever you have a positive experience because you're creating a journal of positivity also you're spending more time on that so you're strengthening the um relation there also socializing is going to help you a lot not only help you find jobs but help you learn so it's almost off my time let's get into holiday CTS because well you've got a group here doing the uni CTF so let's take that group and do other things if you want to do small programming challenges the Advent of code is great if you go into a wide range of hacking puzzles hack event is another good one um I say puzzles because hack event is more like challenge based or not challenge puzzle based it's not exactly going to be realistic but that doesn't mean it's not good I enjoy that event then last but not least my favorite kringlecon which used to be called the Sans holiday hack challenge if you look at my YouTube channel how the heck challenge is the First videos I have ever done it's a really great event for both red and blue team so definitely check it out all of these are free so no reason not to um that's it for my time hope you guys enjoyed it take care and I will see you all next time
