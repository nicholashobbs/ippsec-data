 hey everyone I'm Nick Ippolito and this is a guide on how to get the coins out holiday hack challenge 2016 put on by sands first we're gonna be using burps week to view the WebSocket request poem the geolocation of both coins and NPCs out use the npcs as a point of reference on a map to get an idea where the coins are physically located after that we're gonna be teaching the game altogether debug the JavaScript and do cool things like editor characters move speed send coordinates for a character move to etc so first thing first let's log into the game go over to a WebSocket history and I shouldn't be there already let's clear the history but we see incoming outgoing WebSockets right off the bat as soon as you log into the game we can filter it show only WebSockets that contain the wood coin which is nothing right now but if we move around eventually in one will pop up I'm guessing soon as I change zones the server is gonna come tell me hey there's a coin there we go incoming and W coin it's at 185 145 in the year 1978 there's also another coin at 167 142 in the year 2016 these coins are highlighted because I have NW coin right down there but with those coordinates we can place a mount on a map first thing first zero zero is this top left corner once we scroll all the way top this is your zero moving to the X to the right the number gets bigger moving down on the y-axis that number gets bigger so one-horse open sleigh is at seventy-five to 48 let's say a coin was at like ninety two twenty nine T is greater than 75 so we move over to the right just a little bit to 20 is lower so we move up the coin would be right around this area behind the house the only gotcha is all these houses are bigger on the inside which means the x coordinates don't map one to one so when you open this door you're actually teleporting off to the side of the map over here which is a spot designated for being inside the house little confusing but when you look at the x coordinates of all the NPC's and the houses you'll notice that all them are above 150 150 is around this area if we go all the way to the top there's bushy evergreen he is near the edge of the map on the x side so 130 to 150 s here so if it was 175 you're off over here and that's probably an NPC in this house but let's now debug the actual JavaScript in the game intercepting WebSockets does slow the game down so I'm just going to turn that off since we don't need it anymore once we get all the locations next thing we're gonna press f12 to open up Firefox is developer tools then we're gonna click down here click on the script tab click where it says inline changes to game dot JavaScript well notice everything is on one line which does suck not only for a readability standpoint but Firefox cannot set a breakpoint in middle of a line thankfully there's this one button over here the JavaScript print afire which will make the JavaScript pretty so we can read it and set breakpoints the second thing I want to do is show this command line pop up so I can issue JavaScript commands right from this window a good thing to debug would be the move to function and is that there we go we have it right here and set a breakpoint click this 539 if you right click set breakpoint in this version of Firefox which I believe is 45 for some reason the whole game crashes and later version of Firefox I think that's fixed Firefox 52 and above I believe have fire debug integrated into it Mozilla has acquired fire debug but 45 is what comes on Callie so that's what we're using so click 539 we have a breakpoint the game is broken we can set a variable so we're gonna do this for this object game dot player and P is now my player variable so I can do P dot move speed equals let's say 10 take this breakpoint off play the game and now we see how fast my character actually moves it's just teleporting around the map you can see that one guy walking slowly and yeah I'm just that much faster the second thing we can do go into this console tab and we can do P now dot move to and it's an underscore have to move to and we can set coordinate so I said 9220 let's see where that actually takes us so do this and we move right to 192 20 is we can do p dot move to underscore zero zero and he's gonna go to the most top left portion of this section of the game so you just do that with the coins and you can get all the coins pretty quickly the gotcha though was inside the houses the teleport function does make it a bit of a pain however we can kind of walk around that by just taking an advantage of debugging JavaScript yet again so going back to the script tab let's look at teleport functions searching through receive teleport now that may be a good one let's see what else there is this teleport callback this is what I'm gonna set a breakpoint and we're gonna click here and think if I click this button we can actually see the functions so XY right here the year so again what I say 90 and 220 I think I said before that's what we did take this breakpoint off play the game and i teleported right where i set the previous location to the only got you again once I move the server's gonna teleport me back somewhere to where it originally was but that at least tells you how to where the coin actually is and that will conclude this video hope you guys enjoyed it take care and happy holidays
